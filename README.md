# Student_Management_System
Student Management System is a desktop application built using Python 3.8.
It is an application that maintains, collects and organizes the information of every student of an institution. The information about each student is handled by an admin.
The application has two types of users: Student and Admin. 
A student has somewhat restricted access to the data, which means that he/she can only view and edit his/her personal information by logging in. He/she cannot edit the marks of a subject or view the data of another user.
The admin can add a new student, view and update the information about any student, and also delete a student from the database. The admin also adds announcements which are visible to everyone without logging in.
